# Heroes Tweaker
Heroes Tweaker is a tool to view and edit data located in Tsonic_win.exe, the main executable for Sonic Heroes, written in Visual Basic .NET. This is a legacy program, as using a mod loader is preferred for Sonic Heroes modding over editing the executable itself, and is left only for reference (you can only extract splines from the EXE using this tool, for example).

## Changelog
* Release 1: First release.

** Mission Editor for mission objectives
** Resolution Editor for internal resolution
** Spline Editor to import and export splines as .OBJ files
** Start/Ending Position Editor

* Release 2: Second release.

** Bobsled Editor with similar functions to the Spline Editor.
** Ranking Requirement Editor for the points required in the game's ranking system.
** Unlock Requirement Editor for the game's story mode and emblem requirements.
** Mission Editor for Team Chaotix split from the one for the other teams.
** Resolution Editor removed as editing the resolution did not affect the aspect ratio.

* Release 3: Third release.

** Updated Spline and Bobsled editors to include most, if not all, the game's spline and bobsled entries.
