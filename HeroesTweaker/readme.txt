# Heroes Tweaker
Heroes Tweaker is a tool to view and edit data located in Tsonic_win.exe, the main executable for Sonic Heroes, written in Visual Basic .NET. This is a legacy program, as using a mod loader is preferred for Sonic Heroes modding over editing the executable itself, and is left only for reference (you can only extract splines from the EXE using this tool, for example).
